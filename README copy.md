# PROJECT OVERVIEW Version 3 (current)
---

## Project Description
---
This is the third version of my portfolio website. Once again I decided to start over from scratch, however this time I incorporated the use of Figma to help with the website design. Going for a very minimalistic approach but with some fancy features like spinning icons under the about me section and blocks of projects rather than rows.

## Additional Libraries
---
Bootstrap

## Background Images
---
No background images used this time around. However, since they're in my repo here is the attribution:

## Future features
---
As I construct additional projects that are portfolio worthy, I will apply them to the projects section.
